# persuade_doc2vec

This repo catalogues my attempts to classify discourse elements based on context-independent document vectors.

My conclusions are that this approach is not likely to be successful.

Further efforts would need to somehow incorporate sequence position (where in the text does the sequence appear?) and probably also use encodings from transformers that are context-dependent.
